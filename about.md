## Learning Objectives

This course will teach students the basics of Autodesk Fusion 360. The class is designed for any students who have an interest in 3D modeling and 3D printing, without requiring prior experience. The program will be taught in a series of lectures and demonstrations. The material will be reinforced with in-class assignments and a final team project, through which the students will become familiar with both the modeling software and the printing process. The homework assignments and final project will allow students to apply what they learned in the lectures to real world engineering problems, while also practicing their design skills. Ultimately, the students will come out of the class with the knowledge to create, simulate, and render an assembly of parts.

## Course Structure

Classes will be held twice a week remotely via Zoom, with one lecture and one lab for a total of 3 hours a week.

Lecture Days: Autodesk Fusion 360 will be taught through step-by-step tutorials and instruction that students will follow along with on their own computers. 

Lab Days: The goal of this aspect of the course is to have students further develop their 3D modeling skills by applying them in various creative and practical aspects.  Students will apply what they have learned during lecture to model creative designs to a chosen prompt announced at the beginning of class. We would also like to encourage students to explore 3D modeling by utilizing and developing open-source plugins for the Fusion 360 software. Some designated lab days will be used to introduce interested students to the Autodesk Fusion 360 API, while other students will have an alternative task.  

## Grading

Student performance will be evaluated through 2-3 minor projects, class participation, and a final project. Assignments will be graded on completion, effort, and demonstration of their ability to apply the skills that they learned in class. The final design project will be graded on creativity and effort. Points will be given for participation via checkoff assignments of in-class work due 2 weeks after lecture.
