# 3D Printing and Design DeCal Spring 2021 Final Project Showcase

## What is this class?

This DeCal teaches students about 3D printers and their operation as well as provides an introduction to 3D modeling using Autodesk Fusion 360. It is open to students of all majors and experience levels, and most of our students join the class with no prior experience with 3D printing or modeling. For the final project of this class, students created and rendered an original 3D model of their own design using the tools and techniques they learned this semester. You can find renders of some of the final project in the gallery below.
