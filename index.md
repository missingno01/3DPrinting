## The Course

This course will teach students the basics of Autodesk Fusion 360. The class is designed for any students who have an interest in 3D modeling and 3D printing, without requiring prior experience. The program will be taught in a series of lectures and demonstrations. The material will be reinforced with in-class assignments and a final team project, through which the students will become familiar with both the modeling software and the printing process. The homework assignments and final project will allow students to apply what they learned in the lectures to real world engineering problems, while also practicing their design skills. Ultimately, the students will come out of the class with the knowledge to create, simulate, and render an assembly of parts.

### Student Model Gallery

Here are some models our students created last semester, most of whom had never modeled before the class!
